# Perfectly-Stirred-Reactor-Ignition
Simple python program for identifying point of ignition using CANTERA

A basic tutorial for starting familiarisation in Cantera. 
Does require installation of both Cantera (open-source chemical kinetic package) and Python.
This script should show the user how to find ignition in a perfectly stirred reactor configuration, allowing customisation and application to different fuel mechanisms.
